          <h2 class="h3 mb-3">Why Charleston Groups Love Isle of Palms</h2>
          <p>
            Charleston may be famous for its cobblestone streets, rooftop bars, and King Street nightlife, but Isle of Palms offers the coastal escape that party planners crave. The island’s rental homes are designed for groups, with decks overlooking the Atlantic, private pools, and large kitchens perfect for hosting. Local companies even offer beach bonfire permits, paddleboard tours, and chartered fishing trips, giving you endless ways to entertain your crew before the night even begins.
          </p>
          <p>
            The proximity to other Lowcountry hotspots like Daniel Island, Sullivan’s Island, and Mount Pleasant means guests can easily explore beyond the beach. Whether you’re planning a daytime boat party or a late-night celebration, Isle of Palms is the perfect launch point for a multi-day event in Charleston County.
